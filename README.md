# CREx_EEGPreprocessing_Pipeline
A suite of function facilitating the pre-processing of one or several datasets. It requires EEGLAB to function and, for the moment, imports raw files in *.bdf (Biosemi Data) format. These functions also call certain functions from the ADJUST (Mognon et al, 2011) and the Chronux Toolbox () as implemented in the Prep Pipeline toolboxes (Bigdely-Shamlo et al, 2015) toolboxes. The ADJUST toolbox is included here as some minor changes were made to the script so that it would function correctly with the pipeline.
